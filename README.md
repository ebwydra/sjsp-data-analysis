Final project for a course in data manipulation and analysis exploring a dataset from the Social Justice Sexuality Project.

## Motivations and Research Questions

The Social Justice Sexuality Project is a national survey of Black, Latinx, and Asian and Pacific Islander, and multiracial lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. While LGBT people of color are often pathologized (or ignored!) in the research literature, the aim of the Social Justice Sexuality Project is to document and celebrate the experiences of this population by collecting information relating to five themes: racial and sexual identity, spirituality and religion, mental and physical health, family formations and dynamics, and civic and community engagement.

I wanted to explore this dataset for my final project because I believe that the lives of LGBT people of color should be celebrated and that their voices and experiences should be amplified. The four questions I set out to answer are:

Q1. Are LGBT people who are more religious less likely to be “out” to their families, friends, and other people?

Q2. Is it possible to predict someone's sexual identity with reasonable accuracy based on their stances on issues affecting LGBT people?

Q3. Do older LGBT people of color tend to be more politically conservative?

Q4. When respondents are clustered based on their patterns of involvement in LGBT and POC groups, organizations, and activities, are the resulting clusters diverse with respect to age? What are the characteristics of the clusters?
